1) Asynchronous communication between Client and Server with Datagram Sockets: an easy API like the one
   for the synchronous communication done before. This could include the Observer pattern for the Client.
   
2) Input/OutputStreams instead of DataInput/OutputStreams to make everything more generic?
   Doing so without changing other code, that is to say it uses DataInput/OutputStreams by default but
   the library let the user change the type of stream without adding more variables.
